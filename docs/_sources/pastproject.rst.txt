Fair Vision
-------------

Demographically biased training data (overrepresentation of certain demographics
in a facial dataset) in facial recognition algorithms is known to cause poor 
recognition outcomes in historically disadvantaged populations. We evaluated 
if synthetic faces produced by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could 
mitigate this unfairness in computer vision if used as training data as opposed 
to commonly used facial recognition training datasets such as CelebA and UTKFace, 
which are both known to be heavily biased. The GAN models of AttGAN and NVIDIA's 
StyleGAN2 were the GANs utilized in this task. To do this, it was investigated if 
demographic features of the faces (such as race, age, and gender) generated by GANs 
could be controlled by inputting custom feature vectors into the GAN models tested. 
If so, a demographically balanced dataset of these synthetic faces would be constructed, 
having equal proportions of faces in differing age groups, genders, and races. 
Ultimately the results of this method were inconclusive and the project was concluded.
