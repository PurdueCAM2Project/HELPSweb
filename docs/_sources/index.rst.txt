High-Efficiency and Low-Power Systems (HELPS)
=============================================

About
=====

The High-Efficiency, Low-Power System (HELPS) Laboratory in the Purdue
develops the technology to improve the efficiency and performance of
computing systems. Our research includes computer vision, machine
learning, cloud and mobile computing, embedded systems software
engineering, as well as applications.

Mission
=======

The mission of our team is to **create leaders**. We are always looking for undergraduate and graduate students willing to contribute to energy-efficient computing research. Above all, we want to give students opportunities to grow as researchers and leaders.

**Great research is enabled by mentorship**. Our laboratory aims to cultivate an environment where all students have opportunities to lead and mentor other students. Constructive feedback is essential, and senior members provide junior researchers guidance.
