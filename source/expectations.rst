CAM2 Progress Evaluation Expectations
========================================

Version: |today|

**Note**: Requirements and dates are not final and subject to change. 

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each semester students who participate in CAM2 research are expected to fulfill the requirements outlined in this document. These requirements will give you an opportunity to **prove** you deserve a good grade in the class. The focus of the class is your contribution to the project and ability to communicate that contribution to your teammates and advisors. Your contribution is the work you have done during the semester and the progress you made. 

Contribution to the project will be evaluated by completion of the following requirements:

#) `Research Notebook`_
#) `Presentations`_
#) `Final Report`_
#) `Poster Presentation`_
#) `Peer Feedback and Reviews`_

These requirements will be outlined in more detail below.

Research Notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each student is required to keep a notebook of their activity on the project throughout the semester. Good researchers keep detailed notes so their work can be replicated easily. Keeping good notes is also a primary method used for you to prove your contribution to the project. You are expected to update your notes a several times a week. Purdue expects you to spend 3-5 hours outside of lab per credit hour on your weekly assignments. This time should be reflected in your notes each week to receive credit. 

**Q:** *What should I put in my notes?*
########################################

Notes must be **detailed** and **understandable** not only to you but also **to other teammates**. Students should keep notes during team meetings and during individual work. Every time work is done on the project, notes should be updated. 

The contents of your notes should include (but is not limited to): 

 - What problem are you trying to solve?
 - Why is this problem important for the project?
 - What are some solutions your team brainstormed? 
 - What did you do to help solve this problem?
 - Why did you think this would work as a solution?
 - Did it work how you anticipated? Why? 
 - What did you learn? 

**Q:** *How should I share my notes with my teammates?*
########################################################

The notes you create must be shared on your team Confluence page. Each student should create their own confluence page under their CAM2 team page. 


Setting up your Confluence Page
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The CAM2 Confluence Pages for all the teams can be accessed from the `Purdue CAM2 Research Team Directory <https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PCAM2/Purdue+CAM2+Research+Team+Directory>`_. After you navigate to the team directory page select your team from the schedule. For this example I will use the Forest Inventory Analysis team.

   :width: 50%
   :align: center
   :target: https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PCAM2/Purdue+CAM2+Research+Team+Directory
   :alt: Team Directory

After you have selected your team, select your name from the team member list. Each name will appear in red until your page is created. When you click on a link that a page has not been created for it will automatically create a new page. 


.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/TeamPage.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center
   :target: https://wiki.itap.purdue.edu/display/PCAM2/Forest+Inventory+Analysis
   :alt: Team Page

The page that is created under your name will be where you keep your notes. By default a black page is created. You can add formatting to organize your notes from here. We recommend you use two column format for your notes as highlighted below.

   :align: center
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/NotesPage.png
   :alt: Notes Page

Using two column format will allow you to keep track of each day in a separate entry by labeling it with a date on the left.

   :align: center
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/ExamplePost.png
   :alt: Example Post

You should insert data, graphs, and links to any other resources you mention in your posts. Pictures can be uploaded from other web pages or directly to your page.

   :width: 50%
   :align: center
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/InsertPictures.png
   :alt: Insert Pictures

If you reference code that you have written in your notes insert a link to the pull request or to the lines in GitHub. This allows you to go back and give detailed examples of exactly what you contributed throughout the semester.

   :width: 50%
   :align: center
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/InsertPRLink.png
   :alt: Insert PR Link

You should create new sections each new entry to your notes. New sections can be created by clicking the "Add section" button in the tool bar. Make sure you can follow each entry in your notebook and that they are easy to understand. The more detail you add the better your notes will be.

   :align: center
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/NewSection.png
   :alt: Insert New Section

Make sure you also take detailed notes during the weekly meeting. If you are missing meeting notes it will be easy for points to be deducted from your note grades. You can also add task lists and check boxes to your meeting notes to remind yourself of tasks you are assigned for each week. When you are done updating your notes for the week be sure to click "Update" at the bottom of the page. Confluence also allows you to add comments to your updates and notify people who follow your page.

   :alt: Update

Remember, you are expected to update your notes several times a week. Confluence provides many other tools that were not reviewed in this section. You are free to use any and all of these tools to keep track of your progress. You may also create new types of pages under your notebook page if this helps you better organize your notes. This can be done by clicking the "..." button next to the "Create" button **in your note directory**. When you click the "Create" or "..." button a new page will automatically be created under your current directory. This should be avoided on pages above your personal notes page because you **will not be able to remove any pages you crate**. If you accidentally create a new page you will have to ask an admin to remove the page.

   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurdueCAM2Project/HELPSweb/master/source/images/CreateNewPage.png
   :alt: Create New Page

Note that you must also create a link to your new page or else it will not be accessible directly. 

**Q:** *How will my notes be evaluated?*
########################################################

The notes will be graded at least 5 times throughout the semester at random intervals. In order to ensure you receive full credit for your notes you should update them regularly. Notes will be graded based on the following properties:

#) **Level of Detail** - Your notes should be sufficiently detailed with figures and relevant descriptions. Your contribution to the project should be clear from your notes. 
#) **Reproducibility** - Can your progress be reproduced by your teammates only from your notes? Do you link to other resources you used? 
#) **Regularly Updated** - Are the notes current to your team's progress? Do you have notes for all team meetings?

You are expected to update your notes a several times a week. You are expected to spend 3-5 hours outside of lab per credit hour on your weekly assignments. This time should be reflected in your notes each week to receive credit. 

Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each student is expected to give three presentations throughout the semester:

#) `Description of the Problem Presentation`_
#) `Solution Design and Development Approach Presentation`_
#) `Final Presentation`_

The goal of these presentations is to assess your ability to verbally share your research. This is an important skill for researchers as they are often asked to share their research at conferences. The first two presentations will give you an opportunity to practice for the final presentation. 

Each presentation gives you the opportunity to showcase what contributions you have made. You are expected to give **detailed and informative** presentations that meet the minimum time requirements. It is acceptable to include questions or discussion at the end of your presentation as long as you have given detailed content that meets the minimum time requirements. 

**You must practice each presentation.** Do not imagine that you can give a good presentation without practice. It is not possible. It will be obvious if you do not practice. A bad presentation will negatively impact your grade.

**In addition to the content of the first two presentations, answer some of the following questions:**

 - What has changed about your understanding of the problem?
 - Do your contributions correctly address the problem you proposed? (It's okay if they don't say why!)
 - Do you need to modify your proposed problem or solution to better align with the needs of the project?
 - Do your notes and report successfully communicate your contribution?
 - Have you discovered anything that would change the viability of your solution?
 - How can you improve your documentation and ensure that others can continue your work?
 - Do you understand your contribution and the project well enough to communicate it to others?
 - Is your work well organized so that anyone can understand it?
 - Can you answer detailed questions about the material you are working with?


Peer Feedback
##############

You are expected to give feedback to each of your team members during the "Problem Presentation" and the "Solution Design and Development Approach Presentation". Feedback you gives helps the speaker improve their presentations and speaking ability for the final presentation. 

Although you will likely be listening to information you may already be familiar with you are expected to give helpful and constructive feedback to your teammates. 

Use this `Peer Feedback Form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf12jBhBWNPgwmw7sAjZp5RhTI7P2dNQ3aIVQ2Ui7lKJ09fXA/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_ to provide peer feedback for presenters. 

Note that failure to provide thoughtful and in-depth feedback will effect your grade. 


Final Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another important way researchers share their work is through writing research "white papers". You will undoubtedly be asked to read research papers related to your work throughout the semester. Publications are significant in the research community because it allows other researchers to review and validate the work of the community. Research papers are the primary "products" of a research team and help build the credibility of a research organization within a community. Becoming a researcher means you will have to create these research reports and review reports created by other groups. You can view publications created by members of the CAM2 project `here <https://purduehelps.org/product.html#publications>`_.

During the course of the semester, each CAM2 *team* is expected to create a publication that will be reviewed by your peers. In many cases, teams go on to publish these reports in academic journals or at conferences. This is a great opportunity for you to get experience communicating your work to the world and help build your resume. 

Basic Report Requirements
##########################

#) Each team **must** use `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ to write your report. All CAM2 teams write research papers using LaTeX so it is important that you learn. **Note**: For most draft submissions you must use `Overleaf <https://www.overleaf.com>`_ (free for Purdue students) instead of installing LaTeX manually. Overleaf also makes it easier to share your progress with your teammates.
#) Each report should follow `Professor Lu's IEEE Conferences Paper Template <https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrwwypkdjkwq>`_. Exceptions will be made if your team is planning to submit to a conference that requires a different template. 
#) Each report must be between 6-8 pages. Exceptions may be made if your team is planning to submit to a conference that has different length requirements. Please ask if this is the case. 

Report Draft Submissions
#########################

Your team will submit several drafts of the report throughout the semester to give others the opportunity to evaluate and critique your work. We expect your team to continually revise the content and organization of the report as the semester goes on. This means that although you may only be submitting the "Related Work" section of the paper you may need to revise your "Abstract" to match the "Related Work" section. 

**Note**: Each draft of the report should be submitted as a group assignment on BlackBoard **as a PDF file** and a link **must** be shared to the Overleaf.

Abstract Draft
+++++++++++++++

The Abstract Draft should include the paper title and abstract section. 

The title of the paper should be one or two lines long. You should not exceed two lines. Be informative, not too vague or broad. It is generally a good idea to write up 2 to 5 candidate titles and run them by your co-authors/teammates and advisors.

The abstract section helps the reader determine whether or not the paper is worth reading. A good abstract section is organized as follows:

 - Problem (2-3 sentences)
 - Existing work and deficiencies (2-3 sentences)
 - Your method and why it is better (3 sentences)
 - Evaluation methods (2-4 sentence)
 - Results and comparison (3 sentences)

If you need more help writing your abstract review abstracts from previous HELPS papers `here <https://purduehelps.org/product.html#publications>`_.

Related Work Draft
++++++++++++++++++

Related work section helps give context and creditability to the work you have done. It shows that your team has reviewed the state of the art work in your topic area and improved on it. In many cases you will introduce metrics that can be used to judge how your work improves on the previous state of the art. 

Related articles can be searched for using `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com>`_ or on `Purdue Libraries <https://www.lib.purdue.edu/>`_. Many times articles can be found in the `IEEE Xplore Digital Library <https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.lib.purdue.edu/Xplore/home.jsp>`_ and the `ACM Digital Library <https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.lib.purdue.edu/dl.cfm>`_. If your team is planning to submit to a specific journal or conference you should focus on citing related work from that. Do not imagine that your work is so special and there is no related work. It is not possible that you are the very first person in human history solving this problem. Some people must have investigated similar, possibly exactly the same, problems. If you do not find anything similar, you have not worked hard enough finding related work.

The final number of references should be approximately 2 to 2.5x the number of pages.

Related work section examples can be found in previous HELPS papers found `here <https://purduehelps.org/product.html#publications>`_.

Introduction and Problem Description Draft
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each research paper has an Introduction section. This section provides an introduction to the problem and the area around the research work you have completed. This section should be generally accessible to non-technical readers and show a need for the work you have done in the broader research community. This section is usually about one page and contains the following paragraphs: 

 #. "Big picture", what is the problem? Who cares?
 #. Description of the problem and related work, with citations. The paragraph ends with description of the deficiencies of existing solutions. This section can optionally be included in more detail as a Problem Description section.
 #. An overview of your solution and why it is better
 #. (Optional) You may include an additional paragraph with more technical details about your solution. 
 #. Evaluation and comparison to prior work. Is your method better? How do you evaluate? Better by how much? Why? 
 #. (Optional) Implications. What can be learned from your method?
 #. (Optional) An overview of the structure of the paper. 

Usually, there are no subsections in the Introduction. You **absolutely must** compare your method with other methods, qualitatively or quantitatively. Without comparison, the paper has no value. Do not submit a paper if there is no comparison.

To write a paper, you need to know the following:

 - Goal: Where are you going? What problems are you solving?
 - Plan: How do you want to achieve the goal? What will you do first? second? etc.
 - Plot: What do you say first in the paper? What comes next? What figures or table will you include?

This section gives the readers an opportunity to learn in detail what this paper talks about and why it is important. 

A common mistake among students is the concept "*I will do all the experiments, collect the data, and then write the paper.*" This **will not work**.  These students magically believe "*things will work out*" even though there is no plan.  What will happen?  A lot of their work will never appear in the paper (called *deleted scenes* in making movies). If you have a good plan, you can reduce the amount of deleted scenes (i.e., wasted efforts).

Method Draft
++++++++++++

This is the part of the paper that tells exactly what you did. It is usually about 50% of the paper. It should be detailed and include multiple figures and drawings to help explain your methods and why they are better.

This section will detail to the world what contributions you have made to the CAM2 project and the broader research community. In this section you explain experiments you designed and describe how you carried out your experiments. 

In most cases this section will have several subsections describing in detail how you carried out your investigation. 

Examples of "Method" sections can be found on the `Purdue HELPS website <https://purduehelps.org/product.html#publications>`_.

Final Draft
+++++++++++

In addition to the above draft submissions the final draft will include three new sections the "Evaluation", "Conclusion", and "Future Work" sections. 

The "Evaluation" section should include the details of how you evaluate your work against previous state of the art solutions. What metrics do you use to measure the success of your work. This should include numbers whenever possible. In this section you **must** compare your work to existing methods. How is your method better? How is your method worse? 

The "Conclusion" section gives a concise summery of the results of your experiments and evaluations. This section should also describe what actions can be taken from the work you have done? Specify exactly what the broader community should take away from your work. What are some potential downsides or pitfalls of your research? 

Finally, teams should include a "Related Work" section as the last section of your report. This section details how you intend to improve on your work in the future. This section should be short and provide some new ideas for the research community on where further work can be done on this topic. 

Final Report Grading
####################

You will receive feedback on each draft from the TA on Blackboard. You should review the feedback carefully and adjust your report accordingly. Failure to revise the work based on feedback will cause your grade to suffer.

**NO LATE WORK WILL BE ACCEPTED**

The Final Report submission will be evaluated by your peers. This peer evaluation process is similar to the process used by many academic journals and will allow you to get first hand experience evaluating others work and giving constructive feedback.

Peer feedback will be conducted via Blackboard. Each student is expected to review 2 papers and submit the `Final Report Peer Review Form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegUp1_h6AxHnrpug4zwwCzFE7LzloqIfxkrKegV92YLG9njQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_ during finals week. More information will be available on Blackboard towards the end of the semester. 

Poster Presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students will participate in the 2019 Purdue Fall Undergraduate Research Expo. This event occurs every semester and is a great opportunity for undergraduate researchers to showcase the scholarly work and creative endeavors they have been engaged in through oral or poster presentations.

Participation is required for CAM2 students and gives them an opportunity to showcase their work to university officials, industry professionals, and their peers. 

In the past, many CAM2 teams have participated in this event.

Peer Feedback and Reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students are expected to complete CATME peer evaluations at two points during the semester. Students can access the CATME system via a link will be sent to their Purdue Email.

The first CATME Peer Review will take place on **Monday 9/30 @ 11:59PM**.
The second CATME Peer Review will take place on **Friday 12/6 @ 11:59PM**. 

Failure to complete the peer reviews by the deadline will cause your final grade to suffer.
