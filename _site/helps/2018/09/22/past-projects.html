When sensors are far from the receiver, individual sensor or hop-by-hop transmission doesn’t have enough energy. This project is to create a new sensor network architecture, AIDA, that uses antenna arrays of the distributed sensor nodes to create directional radio waves which can give stronger signals than individual antenna of the sensor nodes. Because of wave reinforcement and cancellation, the signals need to be highly directional and in phase at the receiver point.</h5>

Since mobile devices are battery-operated, energy conservation is very important. We develop techniques for transmission and display of multimedia for devices with different amounts of resources. We remove fine details from images and videos, while preserving significant structural information. Removal of fine details reduces the sizes of images and videos, thereby reducing their transmission energy. We also develop layout generation techniques for adapting multimedia presentations for devices with different display resolutions.</h5>

Most existing techniques focus on individual layers: hardware, operating system (OS), and applications. This project focuses on OS and applications and we propose a cross-layer approach to help OS and applications collaborate for better power management. We instrument OS to measurement power and follow a set of accounting rules to determine the amount of energy consumed by each process. These processes can adjust their behavior to use energy efficiently. For portable systems powered by batteries, some processes may off-load computation to a remote server that is grid-powered. A programming environment has been developed to assist programmers in improving energy efficiency. This project has impacts on improving the energy efficiency of electronic systems to provide services for longer periods of time for mobile users.</h5>
